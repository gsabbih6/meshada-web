            acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by
            these

          <p>You are solely responsible for your use of the Services, for any content you post to the Services, and for

            entity, then: "you" includes you and that entity; and you represent and warrant that you are authorised on
            behalf of that entity to bind the entity to these Terms; and you agree to these Terms on the entity's

            (permanently
            or

            the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or
            broadcast

          <h4>13. Promotions</h4>
          <h4>a) Meshada Promotions terms and conditions (“Meshada Promotion Terms”)</h4>
          <p>From time to time, Meshada may run promotions, including promotional discount codes, which apply to orders
            made
            through our site. These Meshada Promotion Terms apply to all Meshada promotions. Each
            Meshada
            promotion will also have specific terms and conditions. The specific terms and conditions for current
            Meshada
            promotions will be displayed in this section and/or in any communication you may receive informing you of
            the
            promotion (usually email). If there is a conflict between these Meshada Promotion Terms and the specific
            promotion
            terms, the specific promotion terms will prevail.</p>
          <p>By using a promotional code and/or taking part in a Meshada promotion you will be deemed to have read and
            understood the applicable terms and agreed to be bound by them. The Terms displayed on the Meshada sites
            shall
            apply to all Meshada promotions.</p>
          <p>Meshada promotions are an arrangement between you and Meshada, and
            not
            between you and the Retailer Partner. As such, any discount will not be reflected in communications you may
            receive from the Retailer Partner regarding the order. Meshada promotional codes have no cash value, cannot
            be
            transferred, forwarded or reassigned and cannot be redeemed for cash. Meshada promotional codes cannot be
            used
            in
            conjunction with any other offer.</p>
          <p>Meshada reserves the right to suspend, change or cancel any promotion, at any time, at our discretion.
            Meshada
            may
            update these Meshada Promotion Terms from time to time and reserves the right to add to them as and where
            necessary. You should review these Meshada Promotion Terms periodically for changes.</p>
          <p>If you return items bought using a promotional offer, any refund you may be entitled to receive will not
            include the redemption value of that promotional offer. You will receive no more than the amount you paid
            towards the final basket price.</p>
          <h4>b) Retailer Partner Promotions terms and conditions (“Retailer Partner Promotion Terms”)</h4>
          <p>From time to time, Meshada may permit customers using the Meshada sites to take part in competitions and
            promotions
            offered by our retailer partners (“Retailer Promotions”). Retailer Promotions will be subject to any
            specific
            terms and conditions set by the Retailer Partner and usually available on the Retailer Partner’s website.
            You
            should ensure that you read the specific promotion terms and conditions on the Retailer Partner’s website.
            From
            time to time, Meshada may identify that a Retailer Promotion is ‘ending soon’ or is a 'limited time offer'.
            This
            means that the end date for the applicable Retailer Promotion falls within the next six days. Meshada
            receives
            such
            end date information from our Retailer Partners and takes reasonable steps to ensure that this information
            is
            accurate and up to date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you should ensure that you read the applicable
            Retailer
            Promotion terms and conditions on the relevant Retailer Partner’s website for full details and to confirm
            the
            end date. By using a promotional code and/or taking part in a Retailer Partner’s promotion on the Meshada
            sites
            you
            will be deemed to have read and understood the terms relating to the Retailer Promotions and agree to be
            bound
            by them.</p>
          <p>For orders placed via a Retailer Partner’s website, we will provide a promotional code to be entered at the
            Retailer Partner’s checkout. You must ensure that the promotional code is correctly inputted at checkout to
            apply any discount to your order.</p>
          <h4>14. Sanctions</h4>
          <p>Meshada complies with all applicable US sanctions law in accordance with Meshada’s sanctions

          <p>We are not liable to you for any inability to access the Services at any time, for any reason (including

          </ul>
          <p>and to the maximum extent permitted by the law, we expressly exclude all relevant conditions, warranties of
            any
            kind (either express or implied) and other terms which might otherwise be implied by statute, common law or
            the
            law of equity in relation to any liability that you may claim we owe to you in respect of such suspension,
            withdrawal or amendment.</p>
          <p>On termination of these Terms (for whatever reason) all licences and rights granted to you in relation to
            the
            Services shall immediately come to an end.</p>
          <h4>19. Waiver And Severability</h4>
          <p>The failure of Meshada to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such
            right
            or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
          <h4>20. Governing Law And Jurisdiction</h4>
          <p>The American legal system will have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim arising from, or related to, a
            visit to or
            your use of the Services. These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or
            their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and
            construed in accordance with the law of the United States.</p>
          <h4>21. Entire Agreement</h4>
          <p>These Terms are the entire and exclusive agreement between Meshada and you regarding the Services
            (excluding
            any
            services for which you have a separate agreement with Meshada that is explicitly in addition or in place of
            these
            Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Meshada and you regarding the
            Services.
            Other than members of the group of companies of which Meshada is the parent, no other person or company will
            be
            third party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
          <p>You acknowledge that you have not, in agreeing to these Terms, relied on any representation, warranty, or
            undertaking not expressly incorporated in them.</p>
          <p>If any provision of these Terms is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid, such
            unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms unenforceable or invalid as a whole and in such
            event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such
            unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.</p>
          <p>If a dispute arises between you and us, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a
            resolution at the address given below or via e-mail at <a
              href="mailto:legal@Meshada.com">legal@Meshada.com.</a>.
            We
            will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures,
            such
            as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.</p>
          <p>Any failure by us to exercise any right or remedy under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that
            right
            or remedy.</p>

            will
            ensure that any company to whom we transfer our rights or obligations will continue to honor your rights
            under
            them.</p>
          <p>Nothing in these Terms shall be deemed to constitute a partnership between the parties nor constitute
            either
            party the agent or employee of the other for any purpose.</p>

          <h2>Data Protection and Privacy Notice</h2>
          <p>This Notice applies to anyone who visits Meshada’s websites or Meshada’s mobile applications (the “Sites”),
            and
            any
            other platforms Meshada owns or controls and makes available (the “Meshada Platforms”). We refer to the
            Sites
            and the
            Meshada Platforms as the “Services”.</p>
          <p>When you use the Services, you access linked pages or blogs, features and content (including any
            information,
            text, graphics, photos, lists of items compiled by you, comments, reviews, links, or other materials
            uploaded,
            downloaded or appearing on, or linked to the Services) (collectively the “Content”).</p>
          <p>Any personal data about our users (the “User” or “you”) provided to or gathered by the Services is
            controlled
            by Meshada LTD (a company incorporated in England and Wales, with company number 07132083 and with a
            registered
            office at The Minster Building 7th Floor, 21 Mincing Lane, London EC3R 7AG) ("Meshada", “we”, “our” or
            “us”).
            For
            the purposes of General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), Meshada acts as a “Controller” as defined
            under
            the GDPR (“Controller”).</p>
          <h4>1. What Does This Notice Cover?</h4>
          <p>This Notice covers Meshada’s treatment of personal data that Meshada gathers when you access the Services
            and/or
            access the Content. We explain what information we gather, why we gather it and the choices you have
            regarding
            your personal data.</p>
          <h4>2. What Information Does Meshada Collect, and How?</h4>
          <p>As customers, you do not have any legal obligation to provide any information to Meshada. However, we
            require
            certain information from you in order to operate properly, including completing a transaction on your
            behalf.
            Login credentials (email and username) enable us to personalize and improve our services. You hereby agree
            and
            acknowledge that any information you do provide to us is provided at your own free will, for the purposes
            mentioned in this Privacy Notice and that we may keep such information in a database(s) which will be
            registered
            and kept in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
          <h5>a) Information You Provide to Us</h5>
          <p>We receive and store any information you enter on the Services or provide to us in any other way. The types
            of
            information provided by you may include your full name, email address, username, password, home and billing
            address, shipping address, order details of transactions carried out on the Sites, and payment information
            (payment information is held by our payment processors rather than us).</p>
          <h5>b) Information Collected Automatically</h5>
          <p>i. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Sites or use another
            feature of the Services. In other words, when you are using the Services we are aware of it and may gather,
            collect and record the information relating to such usage, either independently or through the help of
            third-party services as detailed below. Meshada automatically receives and records information on our server
            logs
            from your browser including your IP address, certain cookie information (please see our Cookie Policy for
            further information) unique identifiers (such as click IDs) and the page you requested.</p>
          <p>ii. We automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the
            Services,
            similar to user music preference data or to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular
            show.
            Meshada only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that
            would
            identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts
            of
            the Services or another feature of the Content so that we can make the Services appealing to as many
            customers
            as possible, and improve the Content.</p>
          <p>iii. We also collect information about the devices you use to access our Services. This includes, for
            example,
            the type of computer or device you use, the hardware model, operating system and software.</p>
          <h5>c) E-mail Communications</h5>
          <p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Meshada if your computer supports this type of
            program. Meshada uses this confirmation to help us decide how to make emails more interesting and
            helpful.</p>
          <h5>d) Location Information</h5>
          <p>When you download or use apps created by Meshada or its affiliates or subsidiaries and, where applicable,
            have
            requested or consented to location services, we may receive information about your location. We may use this
            information to provide you with personalised content and location-based services, such as search results.
            Most
            mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. To learn more about what information your device
            makes
            available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>
          <h4>3. What About Cookies?</h4>
          <p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Meshada and our partners, affiliates,
            analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Sites,
            tracking users’ movements around the Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a
            whole.
            We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as
            aggregated basis.</p>
          <p>Please see our <a href="/help/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a> for information as to how we use cookies in
            relation to the Services.</p>
          <h4>4. Why Do We Collect Information?</h4>
          <p>We use the information we collect in order to:</p>
          <p>Operate and improve the Services and to display Content</p>
          <p>Allow you to take full advantage of the Services, including using “Wish Lists”</p>
          <p>Allow you to order products on the Sites (where applicable)</p>
          <p>Process or facilitate payments through third party payment processors (where applicable)</p>
          <p>Recommend relevant products, and make it easier for you to track products you’re interested in</p>
          <p>Offer you a personalised experience of the Services and on the Meshada Sites. This process constitutes
            profiling
            under the GDPR</p>
          <p>Communicate with you about your orders and provide customer service, technical assistance and collect
            feedback</p>
          <p>Communicate with you about products, sale reminders, services and promotional offers</p>
          <p>Administer your account if you have one, and update our records</p>
          <p>Enable third-party service providers and contractors to carry out technical, logistical or other functions
            on
            our behalf</p>
          <p>Conduct research, troubleshoot problems, and detect and protect against error, abuse of the Services, fraud
            or
            other criminal activity</p>
          <p>Control risk, comply with laws and regulations, and comply with other legal process and law enforcement
            requirements</p>
          <p>Produce aggregated statistical reports (provided that the reports do not identify customers)</p>
          <h4>5. Where Will We Store Your Information?</h4>
          <p>To provide the Services, the information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a
            destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed and used by staff operating
            outside the EEA who work for us or by one of our third-party service providers. Such staff may be engaged
            in,
            among other things, the fulfilment of your request, the processing of your payment details and the provision
            of
            support services. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that third parties to whom we
            transfer
            any data provide sufficient protection of that data.</p>
          <h4>6. Sharing Information With Third Parties</h4>
          <p>We share your information only as described in this Notice and require commercial entities with which we
            share
            your information to agree to keep it confidential.</p>
          <h5>a) Meshada Partners</h5>
          <p>We work with a variety of partners (“Meshada Partners”) in order to offer you the widest possible choice of
            fashion items on the Sites. There are two ways to buy products through the Services:</p>
          <p>Buying on a Meshada Partner website: Sometimes when you select a product, you will be taken directly to the
            Meshada
            Partner website and asked by the Meshada Partner to provide further personal details related to the
            transaction.
            The information you enter on the Meshada Partner website will be collected, stored, and processed in
            accordance
            with the privacy policy of the Meshada Partner.</p>
          <p>Buying on the Sites via Meshada’s integrated checkout (“Integrated Checkout”): For certain products you
            wish
            to
            buy, we operate an Integrated Checkout service, allowing you to check out these products on the Sites. In
            order
            to process these transactions, we will need to share your transaction information (such as name and shipping
            details) with the relevant Meshada Partner using our secure systems. The information you enter on the
            Integrated
            Checkout will be collected, stored, and processed in accordance with this Notice and in accordance with the
            privacy policies of the Meshada Partners from whom you wish to purchase the products.</p>
          <p>Please note that: (i) you should carefully review the Meshada Partner privacy policy before completing any
            transaction involving a Meshada Partner; and (ii) the Meshada Partner is solely responsible for its use and
            sharing of
            your information.</p>
          <p>Promotions: We may also share your data with Meshada Partners in connection with certain promotions and
            competitions. These will be subject to additional rules and conditions which will be made available to you
            at
            the time of entering any such competition or promotion. You should carefully review the rules and conditions
            relating to such competitions and promotions.</p>
          <p>Aggregate Information: We may also share aggregate information with the Meshada Partners about how our
            customers,
            collectively, use the Content. We share this type of statistical data so that the Meshada Partners also
            understand
            how often people use the Content, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.
            Meshada
            never discloses aggregate information to a Meshada Partner in a manner that would identify you personally,
            unless
            we need to in order to complete a transaction on your behalf.</p>
          <h5>b) Payment processors</h5>
          <p>For purchases made on the Sites via the Integrated Checkout, your payment information (e.g. credit or debit
            card details) will be processed by third-party payment process providers such as Klarna or Stripe.</p>
          <p>Please note: (i) you should carefully review the third-party payment processor privacy policy before
            completing
            any transaction via the Integrated Checkout service; and (ii) the third-party payment processor is solely
            responsible for its use and sharing of your information.</p>
          <h5>c) Affiliate Networks</h5>
          <p>Meshada shares personal data with affiliate networks such as Rakuten (“Affiliate Network”) for the purpose
            of
            Meshada
            participating as a publisher in the Affiliate Network and entering into engagements with Partners. Where the
            Affiliate Network collects and uses personal data for its own permitted purposes, the Affiliate Network acts
            as
            a separate and independent Controller in relation to that personal data. The Affiliate Network will use the
            personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations and will individually and
            separately fulfil all obligations that apply to it as a Controller. </p>
          <h5>d) Advertisers</h5>
          <p>Advertisers and advertising networks may use automated technologies such as cookies to collect information
            about your website activity on the Sites and other sites. This is used to target advertising to you online
            that
            may be of interest to you. For more information on cookies and how to reject targeted advertising or
            interest-based advertising cookies, please read our <a href="/help/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
          <h5>e) Social media and other platform services</h5>
          <p>Information to/from third-party social media services:</p>
          <p>We receive the usernames and passwords for your accounts and profiles on third-party sites with which the
            Sites
            interoperate. For example, by logging into the Sites via Facebook, you are giving us permission to obtain
            certain information from your Facebook account, such as your name and email address. This may give us
            automatic
            access to certain personal information retained by a social media site about you (e.g. content viewed by
            you,
            content liked by you and information about the advertisements you have been shown or may have clicked on).
            Where
            this information is received by us, we will use this information to further personalise your experience on
            the
            Meshada Sites. We may share your data (such as unique identifiers derived from your registration information
            on
            our
            website or app) with these third-party sites. This allows us to link your devices and provide you with a
            seamless experience across different devices that you use.</p>
          <p>We sometimes work with social media services, such as Facebook, to provide custom audiences to partners. A
            custom audience is a type of audience made from a customer list. It is a form of targeted advertising that
            lets
            our partners advertise to their existing audiences who are on Facebook. In the event that Meshada creates a
            custom
            audience, we will use aggregated information we already hold about users such as email addresses. Our user
            information is hashed before it is sent to Facebook. This process turns the information into randomised code
            and
            cannot be reversed.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, a partner might request we work with Facebook to create a lookalike audience. Facebook will
            generate a lookalike audience from a source audience, such as a custom audience, we have already shared with
            them. A lookalike audience is created by Facebook identifying qualities of the people in the source audience
            and
            delivering targeted advertising to an audience of people who “look like” the source audience. A lookalike
            audience is a way for partners to reach new users who might be interested in our Services because they are
            similar to our existing users.</p>
          <p>We may also work with platforms, such as Google, to create audience groups from the email addresses we hold
            and
            retarget users across different advertising networks.</p>
          <h5>f) Analytics</h5>
          <p>We have implemented the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting feature and may share your
            information to analytics and search engine providers that help us to improve and optimize the Services.</p>
          <h5>g) Agents</h5>
          <p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with
            them only to the extent necessary to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently,
            Meshada’s
            agents do not have any right to use the information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist
            us.</p>
          <h5>h) User Profiles and Other Information You Post</h5>
          <p>If the service is available on the Sites, User profile information including your username, name, email
            address, and other information you enter (“User Submissions”) may be displayed to other Meshada users to
            facilitate
            user interaction within the Services and allow you to follow other users, and them to follow you. Email
            addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions.
            Any
            information that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, through
            reviews in product pages, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be viewed, collected, and used by others.
            Any
            images, captions, physical descriptions, personal interests, or other content that you submit to the
            Services
            may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels and may be viewed by the general
            public.</p>
          <p>Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post information to public areas on the Services or any other
            public forums, such information can be accessed by the public.</p>
          <h5>i) To comply with legal requests</h5>
          <p>We may provide your information to relevant third parties when we believe in good faith that it is
            necessary
            in
            order to (i) comply with the law, regulation or a legal request; (ii) enforce or apply our conditions of use
            in
            other agreements; or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of Meshada, our employees, our users, or
            others.
            This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
            credit
            risk reduction.</p>
          <h5>j) Third parties where a corporate transaction is contemplated</h5>
          <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is
            typically one of the business assets that are transferred. In addition, in the event of a merger,
            acquisition,
            reorganization, asset sale, or in the unlikely event that Meshada goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
            customer information may be one of the assets that are transferred to or acquired by a third party. If such
            transfers occur, the third-party transferee may continue to use your information as set out in this
            Notice.</p>
          <h5>k) Affiliates</h5>
          <p>We may share some or all of your information with any of our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint
            ventures,
            or
            other companies under common control with us.</p>
          <h4>7. How is Your Information Kept Secure?</h4>
          <p>We take care to maintain appropriate safeguards and security features to protect the integrity and privacy
            of
            the information you provide us with and to try to prevent unauthorised access to it. We encrypt your
            information
            to protect it from unauthorised use, and we use pseudonymisation, information access controls, and
            firewalls.</p>
          <p>All information you provide to us is hosted and stored on Amazon Web Services cloud-based services in
            Ireland
            which is also in compliant with ISO27001 standard. For further information on the measures taken by Amazon
            to
            protect the security of their servers and your information, please see: http://aws.amazon.com/security/. If
            you
            are not satisfied with the levels of security offered by our cloud provider, you should restrict the nature
            and
            amount of information which you include in your log data or not use the Services. Any payment transactions
            will
            be encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
          <p>If you choose to create an account with Meshada (a “Meshada Account”), the information in your Meshada
            Account
            is
            protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to ensure that there is no unauthorised
            access
            to your account and information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access
            to
            your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. You are responsible
            for
            safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your
            password. Meshada encourages you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and
            lower
            case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. Meshada cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
            damage
            arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</p>
          <p>The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the
            security
            of your data transmitted to the Services. Unauthorised entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other
            factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. Any transmission of data is at your
            own
            risk.</p>
          <h4>8. What About Links To Third Party Websites?</h4>
          <p>The Services contain links to other sites such as Meshada Partners. Meshada is not responsible for the
            privacy
            policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site you should read the privacy policy
            stated
            on that site. This Notice only governs information collected on the Services.</p>
          <h4>9. Data Retention</h4>
          <p>Subject to any legal obligations to keep your information longer, we store the data you provide to us for
            as
            long as is necessary to provide the Services to you (and if you have a Meshada Account, for as long as you
            have
            a
            Meshada Account), or until you ask us to delete it, whichever comes first.</p>
          <p>After a request from a User to delete any data, a process will begin that permanently deletes the relevant
            data. Once begun, this process cannot be reversed and data will be permanently deleted. Any data which is
            not
            deleted shall be kept in an anonymized manner.</p>
          <p>Meshada collects and retains usage data, other metadata and statistical information about the use of the
            Services
            in an aggregated and anonymised format.</p>
          <h4>10. What’s Our Legal Basis for Processing Your Information?</h4>
          <p>We process your information where we have a legal basis for doing so.</p>
          <h5>a) Necessary for our legitimate interest. Our legitimate interests include:</h5>
          <p>Improving the Meshada Sites and Services and offering you a personalised experience.</p>
          <p>Ensuring that our marketing communications, advertising and recommendations are relevant to you. </p>

          <p>Ensuring the Services are managed correctly.</p>
          <h5>b) Necessary for the performance of our contract with you.</h5>

            and
            any
            other additional details you wish to add to your account.</p>
          <h5>c) Based on your consent.</h5>
          <p>For example, where you provide us with marketing consents in order to send you information about products
            that
            may be of interest to you. Your consent may be withdrawn at any time by contacting us.</p>
          <h5>d) Necessary to comply with relevant legal obligations.</h5>
          <p>For example, to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement.</p>
          <h4>11. What rights do You have in relation to the information We hold about You?</h4>
          <p>You have certain rights in relation to the information that we hold about you, which are detailed below.
            Some
            of these rights only apply in certain circumstances.</p>
          <h5>a) Access</h5>
          <p>If you are based in the EU, you have a legal right under GDPR to request access to a copy of your personal
            data
            held by us. To do this, please contact us at gdpr@Meshada.com., use the subject line “DSAR” and include the
            details
            about what personal data you are looking for.</p>
          <h5>b) Deletion</h5>
          <p>To ask us to delete your Meshada Account, please following the instructions in the Account Settings section
            of
            your Meshada Account.</p>
          <p>Please note that although your personal data may be removed from our databases, Meshada may retain the
            anonymous
            information contained in the data you provided, and such information will continue to be used by us for
            statistical purposes.</p>
          <h5>c) Correction</h5>
          <p>If you have a Meshada Account, you can update certain information in your ‘Account’ settings, such as your
            name,
            email address, username, and password. The information that you can update or amend may change as the
            Services
            change.</p>
          <h5>d) Marketing opt-out</h5>
          <p>When you register for a Meshada Account, you can give your consent to receive certain marketing emails or
            other
            communications from us. We will use your information such as your email address to occasionally provide you
            with
            information about products and services which may be of interest to you.</p>
          <p>If you no longer wish to receive marketing messages from us, or if you want to change the type and
            frequency
            of
            these messages, you can change your preferences at any time in the Account Settings of your registered
            Meshada
            Account, or by clicking on the unsubscribe button in our marketing emails. Please note that it sometimes
            takes
            a
            short amount of time to refresh our records for these purposes. We require all Meshada Partners to honor
            your
            opt-out requests if you elect to stop receiving marketing messages. If, for whatever reason, your opt-out
            request is not honored, please let us know and we will attempt to resolve the issues.</p>
          <p>When using the Meshada mobile application, your preferences for receiving push notifications and other
            mobile
            alerts can be configured in the settings of the app or the settings of your mobile device.</p>
          <p>Please also be advised that you may not be able to opt-out of receiving non-promotional, transactional
            messages, or information about your Meshada Account (e.g. service announcements or administrative
            messages).</p>
          <p>You can always opt not to disclose information, even though it may be needed to take advantage of the
            Services.</p>
          <p>Please note that if you choose not to receive or read legal notices from us, such as this Notice, those
            legal
            notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices
            for
            changes.</p>

          <h4>What are “Cookies”?</h4>
          <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your device when you visit certain websites. We use cookies
            to
            understand how you interact with our Services and distinguish you from other users of our Services. Among
            other
            benefits, this allows us to make improvements to the information and design of the Services and to provide
            you
            with better customer experience. The term “cookie” in this policy covers cookies and a range of other
            similar
            technologies, such as pixel tags.</p>
          <p>It is easy to change your cookie settings. Please see ‘How do you opt-out of personalised advertising and
            control other cookie settings?’ for further information on how to do this. However please be aware that if
            you
            delete, disable or opt-out of cookies, your online experience with the Services may be affected and some
            features or areas of the Meshada Platforms and Services may be limited.</p>
          <h4>What type of cookies do we use and why?</h4>
          <p>We use the following categories of cookies on the Meshada Platforms:</p>
          <p><em>Required cookies</em>. These cookies are necessary to allow us to operate the Services that you have
            requested. For example, we use required cookies for site security and site integrity, account
            authentication,
            privacy preferences, maintenance data, to make the site work correctly for browsing and transactions, and
            for
            tracking user conversions on the Meshada Platforms. </p>
          <p><em>Site Customization cookies</em>. These cookies are used to improve your experience of our Services and
            operate according to your preferences. For example, they remember your login details and certain choices
            that
            you make on the Meshada Platform including content that you have viewed previously. Without these
            technologies,
            features like personalized recommendations or account preferences may not work correctly. </p>
          <p><em>Analytical/performance cookies</em>. These cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of
            visitors
            and to see how visitors move around our Services when they are using them. This helps us to improve the way
            our
            Services work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. These
            cookies
            collect anonymous information only and do not show personal details.</p>
          <p><em>Personalised Advertising cookies</em>. These cookies are used to make our Services more relevant to you
            and
            to personalize advertising online that may be of interest to you. For example, they personalize features
            such
            as
            (i) product searches and offers, (ii) recommended content, and (iii) adverts. They do not increase the
            amount
            of
            content that you will be shown, but they will help limit the number of times you see the same content. To

            control

          <p>Please bear in mind that opting out using the CCPA mechanism removes all non-essential cookies. Meshada

          <h4>What are “Cookies”?</h4>
          <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your device when you visit certain websites. We use cookies
            to
            understand how you interact with our Services and distinguish you from other users of our Services. Among
            other
            benefits, this allows us to make improvements to the information and design of the Services and to provide
            you
            with better customer experience. The term “cookie” in this policy covers cookies and a range of other
            similar
            technologies, such as pixel tags.</p>
          <p>It is easy to change your cookie settings. Please see ‘How do you opt-out of personalised advertising and
            control other cookie settings?’ for further information on how to do this. However please be aware that if
            you
            delete, disable or opt-out of cookies, your online experience with the Services may be affected and some
            features or areas of the Meshada Platforms and Services may be limited.</p>
          <h4>What type of cookies do we use and why?</h4>
          <p>We use the following categories of cookies on the Meshada Platforms:</p>
          <p><em>Required cookies</em>. These cookies are necessary to allow us to operate the Services that you have
            requested. For example, we use required cookies for site security and site integrity, account
            authentication,
            privacy preferences, maintenance data, to make the site work correctly for browsing and transactions, and
            for
            tracking user conversions on the Meshada Platforms. </p>
          <p><em>Site Customization cookies</em>. These cookies are used to improve your experience of our Services and
            operate according to your preferences. For example, they remember your login details and certain choices
            that
            you make on the Meshada Platform including content that you have viewed previously. Without these
            technologies,
            features like personalized recommendations or account preferences may not work correctly. </p>
          <p><em>Analytical/performance cookies</em>. These cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of
            visitors
            and to see how visitors move around our Services when they are using them. This helps us to improve the way
            our
            Services work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. These
            cookies
            collect anonymous information only and do not show personal details.</p>
          <p><em>Personalised Advertising cookies</em>. These cookies are used to make our Services more relevant to you
            and
            to personalize advertising online that may be of interest to you. For example, they personalize features
            such
            as
            (i) product searches and offers, (ii) recommended content, and (iii) adverts. They do not increase the

          <p>Cookie settings on the Site. </p>
          <p>All US users may opt in or out of the selling of their personal information according to the terms of CCPA
            legislation using the checkbox featured in Meshada's <a href="/help/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>
          <p>Please bear in mind that opting out using the CCPA mechanism removes all non-essential cookies. Meshada
            still
            uses
            essential first party cookies that will remain unless you also manually delete cookies on your device. </p>

            <li>
              <p>Block cookies: You can adjust your cookie preferences by activating the setting on your browser that
                allows
                you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. The ""Help"" feature on most browsers will tell you
                how
                to
                stop your browser from accepting new cookies. It should also tell you how to set up the browser to
                notify
                you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies entirely. You can also disable or delete
                similar data used by browser add-ons, such as flash cookies, by changing the add-ons settings or
                visiting
                the website of the browser manufacturer. Visit www.allaboutcookies.org for more information about how to
                manage cookies on your particular browser.</p>

              <p>Delete cookies: Your browser will also allow you to delete cookies that are currently set on your
                device.
                Please note that if you delete all of your cookies, all of your existing cookie preferences will also be
                lost. This means that you will see the cookie banner again when you next visit our Site and you will
                need
                to
                reset your cookie preferences. </p>

          <p>Device settings. You may also be able to adjust your cookie preferences in the settings of your device.
            However, the settings you choose will not apply across your devices. This means that if you want to opt out
            of
            cookies on all devices, you must adjust your settings individually on each device and browser on which you
            use
            the Services. </p>
